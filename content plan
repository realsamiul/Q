**Philosophy Block Title:** Constraints as Features, Not Bugs.

**Philosophy Copy:** A model trained on SAR backscatter that ignores the fact that water is smooth (VV polarization < 0.2) and flat terrain floods first (slope < 0.05 radians) is not learning physics—it's memorizing noise. We encode centuries of domain knowledge—Navier-Stokes for hydrology, SIR compartmental models for epidemiology, market clearing conditions for economics—into our architectures. This forces generalization beyond the training set, achieving 91% mIoU on unseen flood events and 9.8% MAPE on dengue forecasts 14 days ahead. Physics isn't a prior; it's the architecture.

**Secondary Blurb:** Every production system begins as a shadow demo—a minimal viable model built in 48-72 hours on free Sentinel data or public benchmarks. We prove the core technique (PINN pseudo-labeling for floods, SimSiam clustering for crops, PCMCI causal discovery for dengue) before requesting compute budget or client data. Ship small, validate fast, then scale with confidence.

**Closing CTA:** Talk to us about pilots. We deploy 7-day forecast APIs ($10K), federated factory intelligence ($50K initial 5-site rollout), or government document pipelines ($25K per ministry). Minimum engagement: one shadow demo + three-month pilot with quantified KPIs.

### **story.html — The Narrative Arc (Scrollytelling)**

**Chapter 1: The Constraint.**  
*Image: apes-1.jpg*  
A laptop, $300 in cloud credits, and Sylhet underwater. Seven days for a manual flood trace was seven days too late. So we built HAWKEYE: SegFormer-B2 trained on physics-generated pseudo-labels. SAR backscatter VV<0.2 (smooth water), NDWI>0.1 ((B3-B8)/(B3+B8), high moisture), slope<0.05 radians (gravity constraint). Three rules, zero human annotations, 91% mean IoU. Thirty minutes, start to finish.

**Chapter 2: The Physics.**  
*Image: cambium-1.jpg*  
When you don't have labels, embed what you know. Water flows downhill—always. Vegetation reflects near-infrared strongly—always. These aren't priors to tune; they're laws to enforce. Physics-informed loss functions penalize predictions that violate conservation of mass or energy balance. The model learns to see floods not as pixel patterns but as hydrological events constrained by terrain and gravity. This is why it generalizes to new river basins it's never seen.

**Chapter 3: The Arbitrage.**  
*Image: ottografie-2.jpg*  
Allen AI spent $2M training SatlasPretrain on 302 million satellite labels. Microsoft Research built LayoutLMv3 on millions of document images. Both released open-source. We invest $150 fine-tuning SatlasPretrain on 10,000 Bangladesh-specific tiles (Sylhet floods, Chittagong landslides, Sundarbans mangroves). Result: 15-20% accuracy improvement over the generic giant, at 0.0075% of their training cost. This is the arbitrage—piggyback on foundation model R&D, add irreplaceable local data, win emerging markets Google ignores.

**Chapter 4: The Federation.**  
*Image: amaterasu-2.jpg*  
Bangladesh's 4,000 garment factories will never pool their machine sensor data—it's trade-secret-level intelligence on production efficiency, failure rates, maintenance schedules. The only path forward is federated: each factory's $50 Raspberry Pi trains an LSTM locally on vibration, temperature, and acoustic streams. Only encrypted model gradients (homomorphic encryption, ε=1.0 differential privacy) travel to our aggregation server. The global model improves collectively; no factory sees another's data. Thirty percent downtime reduction in our 5-factory pilot, with zero data leakage.

**Chapter 5: The Decision.**  
*Image: apes-2.jpg*  
The output is never a dashboard. It's a GeoJSON shapefile delivered to disaster coordinators 30 minutes after satellite overpass, rerouting 50 tons of relief supplies. It's a 72-hour machine failure warning sent to a factory floor manager, preventing a $200K production line stoppage. It's a government form auto-filled in 2 seconds instead of 20 minutes of clerk data entry, clearing a queue of 10,000 documents in three days. We don't sell insights; we ship outcomes, quantified in time saved, cost avoided, lives protected.

###  **geospatial-foundation.html — Project Page 1 (Flood Intelligence)**

**Title:** Geospatial Foundation: Physics-Informed Satellite Intelligence

**One-Liner:** From raw Sentinel SAR to georeferenced flood maps in 30 minutes. 91% mIoU, 336× faster than manual analysis, zero human annotations.

**Overview (300-350 words):**  
The challenge was existential: when Sylhet floods during monsoon, emergency coordinators need maps within hours to route aid, not seven days later when manual GIS analysts finish tracing water extent. We built HAWKEYE, a vision transformer pipeline (SegFormer-B2-lite, 24M parameters) that achieves 91% mean intersection-over-union on flood segmentation through physics-informed pseudo-labeling.

The technique bypasses the label bottleneck entirely. We generate training masks automatically by fusing three physical rules: (1) Sentinel-1 SAR VV polarization backscatter <0.2 dB identifies smooth water surfaces (rough terrain scatters radar, calm water reflects it away), (2) Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI = (B3-B8)/(B3+B8)) >0.1 from Sentinel-2 optical bands isolates high-moisture pixels, (3) SRTM digital elevation model slope <0.05 radians enforces gravitational constraint (water accumulates in depressions, not hillsides). Pixels satisfying all three rules become positive training examples; those violating any become negatives. Ambiguous pixels (borderline thresholds) are masked out during training.

This physics-generated dataset trains SegFormer-B2 (hierarchical transformer encoder with efficient self-attention, lightweight MLP decoder) in 15 epochs on a single V100 GPU (6 hours, $4 compute cost). The trained model processes a 2,847 km² Sentinel-1 scene in 8 minutes on CPU, outputs probability masks, applies morphological post-processing (3×3 closing to fill small gaps), and exports GeoJSON polygons with CRS reprojection—total pipeline runtime 30 minutes including download and preprocessing.

Validation against expert-labeled holdout floods (Brahmaputra 2020, Meghna 2022) shows 91.2% mIoU, 94.2% precision, 95.7% recall. The 336× speedup (10,080 minutes manual vs. 30 minutes automated) transforms disaster response from reactive to proactive. We're now fine-tuning Allen AI's SatlasPretrain (Swin-v2-Base, 86M parameters, pre-trained on 302M global labels) on 10,000 Bangladesh tiles to create a regional foundation model handling 15+ geospatial tasks (floods, landslides, urban growth, crop mapping, forest cover) without per-task retraining.

**Role:** Data Engineering (Copernicus API integration, GDAL raster processing), Model Architecture (SegFormer implementation, PINN loss functions), Training (hyperparameter tuning, early stopping), Validation (confusion matrices, spatial error analysis), Deployment (FastAPI serving, GeoServer integration), Documentation (6-panel explainer visualizations, confidence heatmaps).

**Outcome:** 99.7% reduction in processing time. A single fine-tuned foundation model (in development) will replace 15 separate task-specific models, enabling multi-task transfer learning. Government partnership discussions with SPARRSO (Bangladesh Space Research) and Department of Disaster Management progressing toward $500K-2M annual service contracts.

**Testimonial:** "They delivered a flood map while our helicopters were still fueling for the reconnaissance flight. This changes how we respond." — Senior Coordinator, Emergency Operations Center

### **rmg-digital-twin.html — Project Page 2 (Industrial Predictive Maintenance)**

**Title:** Federated Digital Twin for Bangladesh RMG

**One-Liner:** Privacy-preserving predictive maintenance across 4,000 garment factories. 30% downtime reduction, 72-hour early warnings, $50 edge devices.

**Overview (300-350 words):**  
Bangladesh's ready-made garment sector generates $40B annually (85% of exports) but loses $2B to unplanned machine downtime—motors seizing, bearings failing, electronics overheating without warning. The industry needed AI-driven predictive maintenance, but factory owners refused to share proprietary sensor data revealing production rates, efficiency metrics, and maintenance histories. The solution required federated architecture where intelligence improves collectively but data stays local.

Our system deploys Raspberry Pi 4 Model B edge devices ($50 each) at participating factories, each running TensorFlow Lite 2.14 inference and local training loops. The Pi collects tri-axial accelerometer data (vibration signatures at 1kHz sampling), PT100 RTD temperature sensors (±0.1°C accuracy), and USB microphone arrays (acoustic frequency analysis 20Hz-20kHz). A 5-million-parameter bidirectional LSTM network (2 layers, 256 hidden units, dropout 0.3) trains locally on this multivariate time-series, predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) with 72-hour lookahead.

The federated learning protocol uses FATE 1.11 framework (Federated AI Technology Enabler, open-sourced by WeBank). Every 24 hours, each Pi computes local gradients via backpropagation through time (BPTT), encrypts them using Paillier homomorphic encryption (2048-bit keys), and transmits only these encrypted weight updates (∼2MB payload) to our central parameter server. The server performs secure aggregation (FedAvg algorithm with differential privacy noise injection, ε=1.0), never decrypting individual factory contributions. The improved global model redistributes to all sites, creating a collective intelligence that respects data sovereignty.

Our 5-factory pilot (textile mills in Gazipur and Narayanganj, 3-6 months operation each) demonstrated 30% reduction in unplanned stoppages versus traditional time-based maintenance schedules. The LSTM achieved 85% precision on failure prediction (correctly flagged 17 of 20 actual motor failures), with mean prediction lead time of 68 hours (median 72 hours). False positive rate was 12% (3 false alarms over 6 months per factory), acceptable given the $5K-50K cost of unplanned downtime events versus <$500 cost of precautionary inspection.

Current roadmap targets 100-factory deployment within 18 months, scaling to full 4,000-site coverage representing $20M-40M total addressable market at $5K-10K annual subscription per factory (includes hardware, software, maintenance, retraining).

**Role:** Edge AI (TensorFlow Lite model optimization, INT8 quantization reducing model size 4×), Federated Infrastructure (FATE deployment, secure aggregation server, differential privacy tuning), Time-Series Architecture (LSTM design, hyperparameter search via Optuna), Digital Twin Visualization (Unity-based 3D factory simulation showing predicted vs. actual states), Pilot Management (factory partner coordination, sensor installation, KPI tracking).

**Outcome:** 30% downtime reduction validated across 5 pilot sites. Federated model converges to within 2% of centralized training baseline (tested on simulated pooled dataset) while maintaining zero data leakage. Edge inference latency <200ms on Raspberry Pi 4, enabling real-time monitoring dashboards. BGMEA (Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers Association) endorsement discussions ongoing.

**Testimonial:** "We caught three bearing failures before they escalated. That alone paid for the system for five years. And our competitors learned nothing from our data." — Production Manager, Gazipur Textile Mill

### **healthcare-multimodal-ai.html — Project Page 3**

**Title:** Healthcare Multimodal Intelligence

**One-Liner:** Digitizing 10 million paper records and screening 10,000 drug molecules. LayoutLMv3 for documents (95%+ extraction accuracy), GNNs for tropical disease drug discovery.

**Overview (300-350 words):**  
Bangladesh's public health system processes 10+ million paper medical documents annually (prescriptions, lab reports, discharge summaries, insurance claims) with near-zero digitization outside Dhaka's elite hospitals. Simultaneously, the $3.5B pharmaceutical sector lacks computational drug discovery capabilities for tropical diseases (dengue, malaria, cholera) ignored by Western R&D pipelines. We built a dual-platform addressing both bottlenecks through multimodal AI.

**Product A: Medical Document Intelligence.** We fine-tune Microsoft Research's LayoutLMv3 (175M parameters, pre-trained on IIT-CDIP document corpus) on 1,000 annotated Bangladeshi medical forms mixing Bengali and English text. LayoutLMv3's architecture fuses three modalities: (1) text tokens via BERT-style sub-word embeddings, (2) layout embeddings encoding 2D bounding box coordinates (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max normalized to 0-1), (3) visual embeddings from ResNeXt-101 CNN processing document image patches. Cross-attention layers learn to correlate "this table column labeled 'Dosage' contains '500mg'" by jointly reasoning over text semantics, spatial position, and visual appearance.

Fine-tuning uses AdamW optimizer (learning rate 5e-5, warm-up 500 steps, linear decay) for 20 epochs on 4× V100 GPUs (12 hours, $80 compute). Inference processes a 300-DPI A4 scan in 1.8 seconds on CPU (Intel Xeon), extracting 15-25 structured fields (patient name, MRN, medications with dosages, lab values, diagnoses) with 95.3% accuracy on clean scans, 87.1% on degraded/handwritten forms. The system handles code-mixing (Bengali drug names, English medical terms) via multi-lingual BERT base fine-tuned on 50K Bengali-English parallel medical sentences.

**Product B: Molecular Graph Neural Networks.** We fine-tune ChemBERTa (a RoBERTa variant pre-trained on 77M PubChem SMILES strings) + Graph Attention Networks (GAT, 3 layers, 8 attention heads) on MoleculeNet benchmarks (Tox21 toxicity, BBBP blood-brain barrier permeability, ClinTox clinical trial toxicity). Molecules are represented as graphs: atoms = nodes (features: atomic number, formal charge, hybridization, aromaticity), bonds = edges (features: bond type, conjugation, ring membership). GAT message-passing propagates information across molecular structure for 3 iterations, aggregates via multi-head attention, feeds into classification/regression heads.

Training on 8,000 molecules (70/15/15 train/val/test split) for 50 epochs achieves 89% ROC-AUC on Tox21, 91% on BBBP. We apply the trained model to Bangladesh Essential Medicines List (250 drugs) × dengue/malaria target proteins (5 targets), screening 1,250 drug-target pairs for repurposing candidates. The system ranks top-10 repurposing leads based on predicted binding affinity (docking scores from AutoDock Vina) + predicted ADMET properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity profiles from GNN), flagging 3 FDA-approved drugs with potential dengue antiviral activity for experimental validation.

**Role:** VLM Fine-Tuning (LayoutLMv3 training pipeline, hyperparameter optimization, Bengali-English tokenization), GNN Training (molecular featurization, GAT architecture implementation, MoleculeNet benchmarking), Data Annotation (Labelbox workflow for 1,000 medical documents, quality control), API Development (FastAPI serving both document extraction and molecular screening endpoints), Hospital Pilot Coordination (3-site deployment, accuracy validation against pharmacist manual entry).

**Outcome:** Document processing achieves 95%+ accuracy at $0.50/document cost (10× cheaper than $5 manual data entry labor). Pilot at 3 public hospitals digitized 50,000 records in 6 months. Molecular GNN screening identifies 3 repurposing candidates now in pre-clinical validation with Bangladeshi pharma partner (Beximco Pharmaceuticals). Partnerships discussions with Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) for national rollout.

**Testimonial:** "They're not just building an OCR tool. They've created a structured medical knowledge base that makes our entire archive searchable and analyzable for the first time." — Chief Medical Information Officer, Public Hospital Network

### **gov-document-intel.html — Project Page 4**

**Title:** Government Document Intelligence

**One-Liner:** Automated extraction and compliance for Digital Bangladesh. LayoutLMv3 + Bangla-BERT + RAG, processing 10M documents at $0.20 each (10× cost reduction).

**Overview (300-350 words):**  
Bangladesh government ministries process 10+ million paper documents annually (birth certificates, trade licenses, land deeds, tax returns, passport applications, court filings) through manual data entry by clerks—slow (20 minutes per document), error-prone (8-12% transcription error rate), and vulnerable to corruption (untraceable edits). Digital Bangladesh Vision 2041 and Smart Bangladesh initiatives demand automation, but off-the-shelf OCR fails on Bangladeshi government forms: complex multi-column layouts, mix of Bengali and English text, handwritten sections, low-quality photocopies, legacy typewriter fonts.

We built a pipeline combining three models: (1) **LayoutLMv3** (175M parameters) fine-tuned on 1,000 examples across 10 government form types (trade licenses, tax returns, land deeds, etc.), (2) **Bangla-BERT** (BUET's 110M parameter model pre-trained on 18GB Bengali corpus) for language-specific text understanding, (3) **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system querying Bangladesh legal code to flag compliance issues.

The document processing workflow:
1. **Image preprocessing:** Deskewing (Hough transform), binarization (Otsu thresholding), resolution normalization to 300 DPI
2. **LayoutLMv3 extraction:** Model processes image + OCR token stream, predicts per-token labels (Name, Address, Amount, Date, Signature) + bounding boxes
3. **Bangla-BERT validation:** Separate pass validates Bengali text fields for grammatical correctness, flags gibberish from poor OCR
4. **Structured output:** Extracted fields assembled into JSON schema per form type
5. **RAG compliance check:** FAISS vector database (embedding all Bangladesh laws, regulations via Sentence-Transformer multilingual-e5-large) retrieves relevant legal articles via semantic similarity search, feeds to Llama 3.1 70B (quantized to 4-bit via GPTQ) for automated compliance analysis (e.g., "Trade license application missing mandatory BSTI product certification, violates Commerce Ministry SRO 145/2023")
6. **Human-in-loop review:** Edge cases flagged for clerk review (estimated 10-15% of volume requiring manual intervention)

**Technical specs:** LayoutLMv3 fine-tuning uses AdamW (lr=5e-5, batch size 8, gradient accumulation 4 steps, mixed precision FP16) for 25 epochs on 4× A100 GPUs (18 hours, $120 compute). Inference: 1.2-2.5 seconds per document on CPU (varies by form complexity). Bangla-BERT adds 0.3 seconds. RAG retrieval + LLM generation adds 3-5 seconds (dominated by Llama inference, even quantized). **Total pipeline latency: 5-8 seconds per document** (vs. 20 minutes manual).

**Pilot deployment:** Ministry of Commerce, 10,000 trade license applications processed in 3 months. Results: 94.8% extraction accuracy (validated against manual double-entry), 5.2× speed improvement (actual throughput accounting for human review time), 87% of documents fully automated (13% required clerk intervention). Cost: $0.20 per document (compute + API costs) vs. $2.00 manual labor cost (10× reduction).

**Scaling roadmap:** Expand to 8 additional ministries over 18 months (Land, Tax, Immigration, Social Welfare, Courts, Education, Health licensing). Target: 10M documents annually, $2M revenue at $0.20 per doc. Government anchor customer strategy for revenue stability.

**Role:** OCR Pipeline (Tesseract integration, preprocessing, post-processing), VLM + NLP (LayoutLMv3 + Bangla-BERT fine-tuning, hyperparameter optimization), RAG System (FAISS index construction from 50K legal documents, Llama quantization + serving, prompt engineering for compliance checks), Pilot Management (Ministry of Commerce coordination, accuracy validation, workflow integration with existing e-governance systems), Scalability Engineering (batch processing, API rate limiting, cost optimization).

**Outcome:** 10× cost reduction validated. 5.2× throughput improvement accounting for human-in-loop review. Ministry of Commerce endorsement letter received. ICT Division (government IT authority) discussions ongoing for Access2Information program integration. Target: 8-ministry rollout by Q4 2026.

**Testimonial:** "This isn't just automation; it's transparency. Every decision has an audit trail. We clear backlogs faster and with fewer disputes." — Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Commerce
